<h1>Si Juan Tamad at ang mga Pulgas<h1>
<h5>Lazy Juan and the Fleas</h5>

<hr>

<p>One day Lady Petra tasked her son, who many called Lazy Juan.</p>
<p>"Pumunta ka <i>[Go]</i>, anak <i>[son]</i>, sa bayan at bumili ka ng isang palayok [to the city and buy a rice cooker].</p>
<p>Mag-ingat ka sana upang hindi yaon mabasag [Take care so that it doesn't break]. Huwag ka ring magbubulakbol [No horseplay]. Umuwi ka agad [Head home straightaway], " the lady said</p>
<p>It so happened on that day a sizable, pestilent cloud of fleas hit the nearby city. No one knew where it came from or how it started. You could see people itching and scratching all around. The entire village was angry, but there was nothing they could do. Scratches and sores covered the legs, arms, and bodies of many. Juan, who lived in the countryside, had no idea.</p>
<p>After buying the the palayok Juan headed home. Just then a lone flea jumped into his britches. It crawled up and chose to bite him on the tummy. He yelped and dropped the palayok. C-R-A-C-K!</p>
<p>Just as you would expect the rice cooker shattered. "Tiyak akong lalantakan ng palo ni Inang sa nangyari ito [I'm sure to get a licking from the old lady for what happened], " whispered Juan. He clapped his hands in front of the palayok shards and thought of a good idea.</p>
<p>He momentarily gathered the broken pieces. After, he searched out two large stones and used them to grind the palayok into fine dust. Afterwards he grabbed a banana leaf from a nearby garden and made satchels to carry the powder-fied rice cooker. He returned to the city center.</p>
<p>Bili na kayo ng mabisang pamatay ng pulgas [Come get the best flea killer]!</p>
<p>Bili na kayo ng mabisang pamatay ng pulgas [Come get the best flea killer]!</p>
<p>He repeatedly shouted as he walked back</p>
<p>Soon enough his wares were quickly sold. No one haggled. Honestly the urbanites were happy simply because they had a solution for the fleas.</p>
<p>Juan headed home straightaway. His mom was overjoyed as he showed her his earnings from his sales.</p>
<p>Now because the need for a rice cooker was so great, he was asked to head back into town and buy another palayok</p>

<p>"Giliw <i>[My love]</i>," said the warrior. "tinatawag na Ako <i>[I am being summoned]</i>. Haharapin nami't lalabanan and mga Kastilang nais maghari sa ating lupain <i>[We are about to face and fight the Kastila who desire to rule our lands]</i>. Ipangako mong hindi ka lilimot <i>[Promise you won't forget]</i>!"</p>
<p>"Ipinangangako Ko <i>[I promise]</i>. Ikaw lamang ang iibigin ko't mamahalin habang buhay <i>[You're the only one I'll ever love and cherish my entire life]</i>. At tandaan mo <i>[And remember]</i>: Sumpa Kita na di lilimutin <i>[I vow to you I will not forget]</i>!" Liwayway's words were forthright and binding.</p>
<p>"Oo, sumpa Kita <i>[Yes, I vow to you]</i>!" countered the young man. They embraced tightly before turning away.</p>
<p>After a few days Liwayway received saddest news. Datu Galing was slain in battle. The young maiden fell ill from heartbreak and not soon she passed. The entire town of Masamyo grieved.</p>
<p>A few months went by. Strange plants with white heart-shaped flowers grew over Liwayway's grave. It grew thickly and quickly spread.</p>
<p>"Sumpa Kita <i>[I vow to you]</i>!" pronounce the hearts who understand when exchanging fresh bouquets of the blossoming plant. Soon the people called beautiful flower by the same phrase. As time rolled on "Sumpa Kita" smoothed into "Sampagita".</p>
