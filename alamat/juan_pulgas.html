<h1>Si Juan Tamad at ang mga Pulgas<h1>
<h5>Lazy Juan and the Fleas</h5>

<hr>

<p>One day Aling Petra tasked her son, who many called Juan Tamad.</p>
<p>"Pumunta ka, anak, sa bayan at bumili ka ng isang palayok. <i>[Go, son, to the city and buy a clay rice pot.]</i></p>
<p>Mag-ingat ka sana upang hindi yaon mabasag. Huwag ka ring magbubulakbol. Umuwi ka agad, <i>[Take care so that it doesn't break. No horseplay. Head home straightaway,]</i>" the lady said</p>
<p>It so happened on that day a sizable, pestilent cloud of fleas hit the nearby city. No one knew where it came from or how it started. You could see people itching and scratching all around. The entire village was angry, but there was nothing they could do. Scratches and sores covered the legs, arms, and bodies of many. Juan, who lived in the countryside, had no idea.</p>
<p>After buying the the palayok Juan headed home. Just then a lone flea jumped into his britches. It crawled up and chose to bite him on the tummy. He yelped and dropped the palayok. C-R-A-C-K!</p>
<p>Just as you would expect the clay rice pot shattered. "Tiyak akong lalantakan ng palo ni Inang sa nangyari ito, <i>[I'm sure to get a licking from the old lady for what happened,]</i> " whispered Juan. He clapped his hands in front of the palayok shards and thought of a good idea.</p>
<p>He momentarily gathered the broken pieces. Then he searched out two large stones and used them to grind the palayok into fine dust. Afterwards he grabbed a banana leaf from a nearby garden and made satchels to carry the powder-fied clay pot. He returned to the city center.</p>
<p>Bili na kayo ng mabisang pamatay ng pulgas <i>[Come get the best flea killer]</i>!</p>
<p>Bili na kayo ng mabisang pamatay ng pulgas <i>[Come get the best flea killer]</i>!</p>
<p>He repeatedly shouted as he walked back</p>
<p>Soon enough his wares were quickly sold. No one haggled. Honestly the urbanites were happy simply because they had a solution for the fleas.</p>
<p>Juan headed home straightaway. His mom was overjoyed as he showed her his earnings from his sales.</p>
<p>Now because the need for a rice cooker was so great, he was asked to head back into town and buy another.</p>
<p>Juan was a little nervous about heading back into town. Sure enough as he walked in a large crowd surrounded him. They were very angry. They harassed him and many even wanted to hit him. Thankfully a few of the elders protected him</p>
<p>"Talaga! Talagang uutasin ka namin, manlilinlang! <i>[Truly! We're going to kill you for sure, you deciever!]</i>" yelled the city-folk.</p>
<p>"Hindi pala pamatay ng pulgas ang inilako mo kundi sandakot na buhangin! <i>[Turns out you weren't selling flea killer, but a fistful of sand!]</i>" screamed the refrain.</p>
<p>"Kapag hinidi ka makapagbigay ng mabuting paliwanag at kakatayin ka naming parang aso! <i>[If you don't explain yourself we'll dismember you like a dog!]</i>" a few added.</p>
<p>Juan Tamad didn't lose hope. "Hintay kayo! Huwag kayong padalus-dalos! <i>[Hold up! Don't be hasty!] he chirped. "Magpalinawagan tayo mga kabayan! Paano ba ninyo ginamit ang pamatay ng pulgas? [Let's clear things up here my people! How did you deploy the flea killer?]</i>"</p>
<p>"Anu pa, di ibinudbod sa mga lugar na may pulgas, <i>[How else, we spread it around any place with fleas,]</i>" responded those closest.</p>
<p>"Nakow, 'yon na nga ba'ng inaalala ko e! <i>[Oh dear, that's what I thought eh!]" retorted Juan."Meron pa ba kayong natitirang pulbos na pamatay ng pulgas? [Do you have any flea killing powder left?]</i>"</p>
<p>"Ano pa'ng matitira e naubos na, ulol! <i>[What leftovers? It's all finished, you fool!]</i>" trumpeted by an especially ornery man.</p>
<p>"Sayang, <i>[Unlucky,]</i>" sighed Juan, "sanay napakita ko sa inyo kung paano madaling mapatay ang pulgas. <i>[I wish I could have shown you how to quickly kill the fleas.]</i>"</p>
<p>"Sabihin mo ang paraan, madali! Kung hindi'y malalagot ka! <i>[Quickly, spill the beans! Otherwise you're dead!]</i>"</p>
<p>"Humuli kayo ng pulgas, <i>[Catch some fleas,]</i>" Juan started. "Pagkatapos e buksan n'yo ang mga mata niyon. At saka lagyan ng pulbos na pamatay. <i>[Then open their eyes. Finally, sprinkle the powder therein.]</i>"</p>
<p>Hard laughter erupted from those who heard his words. They clutched their sides and crumpled; strugging for breath.</p>
<p>"Kung humuli lamang ng pulgas e mahirap na, paano pa kaya ang pagbubukas sa mga mata niyon, gago! <i>[If catching them is hard, how do you expect we open their eyes, idiot!]</i>"</p>
<p>"Hala, pakawalan ang luku-lukong 'yan. At uli-uli'y huwag ka nang magtitinday ng pamatay ng pulgas, kung hindi mo ibig matodas ang iyong lahi. [Stop, let this lunatic go. And don't ever sell any flea killer, if you don't want your line extinguished.]"</p>
<p>Juan Tamad went home; secretly happy of his wily victory.</p>
